# advent-20XX-rust

This is my code for the 20XX [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/20XX),
all solutions in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

All code is under the `src` directory. Each solution-file is named `dayNN.rs`
and contains both puzzle solutions for that day. These are the
publically-facing functions `part1` and `part2`. Unlike the code I use to
actually do the AoC challenge, this is written well after the fact.

## Usage

This project is managed with [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/). Running
the following will download any dependencies and build the executable:

```
cargo build
```

# Advent of Code Rust Basis

Starter pack for doing [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) in
Rust. This is based largely on
[this template](https://github.com/nickyvanurk/advent-of-code-rust-template).

## Checklist

Once this template is used to create a new repo, do the following:

1. Edit `LICENSE` to change `20XX` to the current year
2. Edit this file to change `20XX` to the current year
3. Delete everything from second level-1 header ("Advent of Code Rust Basis")
   to the end
